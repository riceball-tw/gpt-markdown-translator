I am translating a technical blog post written in Chinese.
Please translate the Markdown content I'll paste later to {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}.

You must strictly follow the rules below.

- Never translate `publishDate` and `category` and `social` fields.
- Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.
- Never change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug.
- Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
